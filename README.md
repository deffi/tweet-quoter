# tweet-quoter
A userscript that formats tweets in a way suitable for copy & pasting.

This userscript adds a text area below the tweet. The text area contains
the tweet text (with empty lines removed) and an attribution line.

This also works around and issue on Firefox where copying the text of
a tweet removes line breaks.
